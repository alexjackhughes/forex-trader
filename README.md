This is me testing a few of the more advanced Redux tools, completed over a couple of hours.

It's a very simple app that calls an open source API for the current prices of
currencies and and a few commodities, and displays their current price as
compared to the Euro in a nice way that also uses a cool flag for each country.

You can see a live demo [here](https://forex-mycfnqvdyu.now.sh).
